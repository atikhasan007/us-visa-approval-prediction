    "\n",
    "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the United States permits foreign workers to come to the U.S. to work on either a temporary or permanent basis. The act also protects U.S. workers against adverse impacts on the workplace and maintains requirements when employers hire foreign workers to fill workforce shortages.  \n",

    "## 1) Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "- The OFLC provides job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications.  \n",
    "- In recent years, the number of applicants has increased significantly, making manual evaluation difficult. Therefore, OFLC needs Machine Learning models to help shortlist visa applicants based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use the provided dataset to build a **classification model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict whether a visa will be **approved or denied** based on given features.  \n",
    "- Recommend suitable applicant profiles for certification or rejection based on important decision criteria.  \n",
